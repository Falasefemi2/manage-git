# Project Git Account Manager (CLI) in Java

## What is this project?

- I built a Command Line Interface (CLI) Tool that allows users to manage their GitHub account without needing GitHub Desktop or browser.

- The Cli will help users:

| Attempt | #1  | #2  | #3  | #4  | #5  | #6  | #7  | #8  | #9  | #10 | #11 |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seconds | 301 | 283 | 290 | 286 | 289 | 285 | 287 | 287 | 272 | 276 | 269 |
